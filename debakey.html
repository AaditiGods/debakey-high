**Electives best for medicine: Psychology, Statistics, Human Anatomy, Sociology**

<p>Many medical students fall into the trap of completing too many extracurricular activities instead of focusing on just one. Medical schools look for how committed an applicant is to an activity outside of school. Taking this information into account, I plan to be a part of the Math Club, the Science Olympiad team, and the National Honor Society.<br>

Plus, I have been doing Bharatanatyam, an Indian classical dance for almost 7 years now and have been consistently participating in dance competitions and events.<p/>

<img src="file:///C:/Users/S1981382/Pictures/rainbow.PNG" width="250" height="200"> <strong> Advice: <br> DeBakey is not just sunshine and rainbows! Just kidding!</strong>
<p>DeBakey High School will help me gain credits for all the courses listed above. <br>
Also, I will have a significant advantage over other students because I was a student of two of the best schools in Texas: <strong>T.H. Rogers</strong> and <strong>DeBakey High School!</strong><br>
My major takeaway from this is that DeBakey High School does indeed have a rigorous curriculum, and in order to successfully complete my A.P. classes, along with the exams, I will need to <em>regularly</em> study the topics, and <em>actively purchase</em> books pertaining to thatparticular subject during the summer, if possible.
